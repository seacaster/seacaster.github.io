I'm Adrian Wang, a junior at the University of Pennsylvania. I study [Networked and Social Systems Engineering](https://www.nets.upenn.edu/), which means that my friends still ask me what my major is on a regular basis.

I'm also the principal trumpet of the [Penn Symphony Orchestra](https://www.dolphin.upenn.edu/pennorch/), which is currently creating virtual concerts of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5 and Copland's Appalachian Spring.
